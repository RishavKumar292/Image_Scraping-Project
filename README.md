# Image Scraper and Downloader
This project is a web application built using Flask that allows users to search for images on Google, scrape them, and download them if desired.

## Features
* Image Search: Users can input a search query, and the application scrapes Google Images for relevant images.
* Image Display: The scraped images are displayed on the web page for users to browse through.
* Image Download: Users have the option to download any image by clicking on it.
## Technologies Used
* Flask: Python micro web framework used for building the web application.
* Beautiful Soup (bs4): Python library for web scraping used to parse HTML and extract data from web pages.
* Requests: Python library for making HTTP requests used to fetch web pages and images.
* HTML/CSS: Used for designing and structuring the web pages.
* MongoDB (optional): Support for storing scraped image data in a MongoDB database.
## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
3. Run the Flask application by executing python app.py.
4. Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5000/.
5. Enter a search query in the provided input field and click "Search".
6. Browse through the scraped images and click on any image to download it.
## Deployment
This application can be deployed to various platforms such as Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform for production use. Ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented, especially if storing user data or interacting with third-party services.

## Notes
* Google Blocking: Be cautious about scraping Google search results, as Google may block your IP address if it detects automated scraping activity. Use techniques like rotating proxies or user-agent strings to mitigate this risk.
* Data Privacy: If storing user data, ensure compliance with data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA. Consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing user data to protect privacy.
* Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle failures such as network errors or HTML parsing errors.
* Security: Protect against common web vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) by implementing appropriate security measures.
* Maintenance: Regularly update dependencies and review code for security vulnerabilities and performance optimizations.
